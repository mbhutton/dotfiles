# Dependency chain: brew_completions, prezto_zshrc, init_completions

# Note: it's not clear why the 'compinit' call is needed here when also
# using prezto's completion module, as that module also
# calls compinit, with the homebrew functions already in fpath.
# But without this extra compinit call below, homebrew's completions don't work.
# Due to that, and to handle the case where the prezto completion module is not
# loaded, always also call compinit here.
