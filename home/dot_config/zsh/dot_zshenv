# Set XDG_*_HOME variables to their ideal default values according to the XDG spec:
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
#
# This shouldn't be necessary because the XDG spec says that if these variables
# are unset, they should default to the values below.
# However some apps (such as lazygit) read the variables but don't default to
# these default values, so set them explicitly.
#
# Setting these attempts to:
# (a) reduce clutter in the home directory, and
# (b) align macOS with Linux.
